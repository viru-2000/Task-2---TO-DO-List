🚀 Introducing My To-Do List App! 📝

I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on: a simple and efficient To-Do List app designed to boost your productivity and keep your tasks organized.

🔍 Key Features:

Intuitive Interface: The app has three main sections - Add Item, To-Do Tasks, and Completed, making navigation seamless.
Easy Task Management: Add new tasks with a click, mark them as complete, and delete them effortlessly.
Responsive Design: Manage your tasks on any device, be it your phone, tablet, or desktop.
Clean Code: The app is powered by efficient code ensuring a smooth user experience.

✨ How It Works:

Add Tasks: Type in your new task and hit the add button. Your task is instantly added to your To-Do list.
Manage Tasks: Each task comes with a checkbox and a delete button. Check off tasks to mark them as complete.
Review Completed Tasks: Switch to the Completed section to review and delete completed tasks.

🔧 Tech Stack:

HTML & CSS for structure and styling
JavaScript for functionality
Material Design Lite (MDL) for a sleek and modern look
Check out the code and see how it all comes together! 💻



I’m always open to feedback and suggestions. Let’s connect and discuss how this app can be further improved!
